A spinlock is a low-level synchronization mechanism used in multithreading to 
protect a critical section.Instead of putting a thread to sleep when the lock is busy, 
the thread keeps looping (spinning) until the lock becomes available.

How a Spinlock Works :
A thread tries to acquire the lock.
If the lock is free, the thread acquires it and enters the critical section.
If the lock is busy, the thread keeps checking repeatedly (busy waiting).
Once the lock is released, one spinning thread acquires it.
👉 The thread never sleeps while waiting.

int pthread_spin_init(pthread_spinlock_t *lock, int pshared);
lock → pointer to spinlock variable
pshared
PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE → used within same process (most common)
PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED → shared between processes (shared memory)

int pthread_spin_lock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
Acquires the spinlock.
If lock is free → thread acquires it
If lock is busy → thread spins (busy wait) until released
❗ Thread does NOT sleep

int pthread_spin_unlock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
Sets lock state to unlocked
Allows another spinning thread to acquire it

int pthread_spin_destroy(pthread_spinlock_t *lock);
Spinlock must not be locked when destroying
Using destroyed lock → undefined behavior
