A message queue is an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism that 
allows processes to exchange data in the form of messages.
Why Message Queue?
✔ Sender and receiver do not need to run at the same time
✔ Asynchronous communication
✔ Messages can have priority
✔ No shared memory → safe communication
Basic Working
Process A creates a message queue
Process A sends a message
Process B receives the message
Message is removed from the queue after reading
Function	Purpose
msgget()	Create / access queue
msgsnd()	Send message
msgrcv()	Receive message
msgctl()	Control / delete queue
struct msgbuf {
    long mtype;     // message type (must be > 0)
    char mtext[100]; // message data
};
two types :
1)id based -> no need any system call direct id pass
2)key based -> key is generated using ftok() system call
