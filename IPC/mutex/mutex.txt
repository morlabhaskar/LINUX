A mutex (short for Mutual Exclusion) is a synchronization mechanism 
used in Linux to protect shared resources when multiple threads run concurrently.

int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex,const pthread_mutexattr_t *attr);
Initializes a mutex object.
mutex → pointer to mutex
attr → mutex attributes (NULL = default)

int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
Locks the mutex.
If already locked → calling thread blocks

int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
Unlocks the mutex.
Only owner thread can unlock

int pthread_mutex_destroy(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
Destroys the mutex and frees resources.
Mutex must be unlocked before destroying.

0        → success
Non-zero → error
