Shared Memory is the fastest Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism in Linux.
It allows multiple processes to access the same memory region to exchange data without kernel.
Types of Shared Memory in Linux
System V Shared Memory (shmget, shmat)
POSIX Shared Memory (shm_open, mmap)
👉 Below is the commonly taught System V Shared Memory (used in OS & Embedded syllabi).
System V Shared Memory – Working Steps
Create a shared memory segment
Attach it to process address space
Read / Write data
Detach shared memory
Destroy shared memory

$ipcs -m     # list shared memory
$ipcrm -m <shmid>   # delete shared memory
